# Project 1 -- C Programming Practice and Implementing xv6 System Call

This is an individual project divided into two parts.  For part 1 you will practice your C programming skills and for part 2 you will implement a system call in the xv6 operating system.

## Project Administration and Policies

**Due date:** Tuesday, September 16th, 11:59pm

Follow all CS 537 [project policies](Admin.md).

## Project Workflow

Your solution code will be tested in the [CS 537 Docker container](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs537/useful-resources/cs537-docker).  Follow the instructions in that repository to create the proper environment.  After following those instructions you should have a `cs537-projects/` directory where you can clone all of the projects for this course.

Follow the suggested [workflow](Workflow.md) for development of your solution.

## Project Instructions

This project is divided into two parts:

- For [Part 1](Instructions-part1.md) you will be developing a grade sorter program to practice your C programming skills.
- For [Part 2](Instructions-part2.md) you will be modifying the xv6 Operating system to create a new system call and creating a user-level program which calls that new system call.
