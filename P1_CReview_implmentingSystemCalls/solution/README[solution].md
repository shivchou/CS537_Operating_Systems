all working - part 1 and part 2 tests passed.

implementation:

part 1: check args, read/parse csv into student objects, sort based on k-th score or average using qsort

part 2: add field to proc struct, set to '/' when process starts, edit fork() so that child has same path as parents, write syscall getcwd() to access p->cwdName, call getcwd() in pwd().
