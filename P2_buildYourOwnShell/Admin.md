# Project Administration and Policies

* **Due Dates**: Unless otherwise communicated, projects will be released by
  Wednesday and due on Tuesday at midnight 2 weeks later.

* **Collaboration**: CS 537 has individual and team projects. For individual
  projects, all work must be your own. For team projects, all work must be
  completed by members of the team. Copying code is considered
  cheating. [Read this](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/dontcheat.html)
  for more information on what is okay and what is not. Please help us all have
  a good semester by not doing this.

* **Questions**: We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/mf19xjonaw03kw)
  for all project questions.

* **Environment**: All tests will be run from
  the [CS537-Docker container](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs537/useful-resources/cs537-docker)
  environment, which is a linux (Ubuntu 22.04) environment with development and
  additional tools installed. The linux manual has not been included in this
  container. We suggest using [Linux Man Pages Online](http://man.he.net/) to
  search the manual.

* **Tests**: A few sample tests are provided in the project repository. To run
  them, from within
  the [CS537-Docker container](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs537/useful-resources/cs537-docker),
  go to the project's `tests/` directory and execute `run-tests.sh`. Read the
  `README.md` file in that directory and try `run-tests.sh -h` to learn more
  about the testing script. Note, these test cases are not complete, and you are
  encouraged to create more on your own.  **When grading, additional unreleased
  tests may be used.**

* **Submission**: To submit your work, you must push to the `main` branch of
  your project's repository
  on [DOIT's Gitlab instance](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/).

* **Late Days**: Projects will continue to be graded for three days past the due
  date and will not be accepted after the third day. Project grades receive a 10
  percentage point penalty for each day late.

* **Slip Days**:  You will have a bank of 2 slip days for the first 3 individual
  projects and 2 additional slip days for the 3 team projects. These slip days
  will be automatically deducted from your bank rather than taking a penalty.
  Once they are used, the late day penalty will be applied. This all happens
  automatically so you do not need to ask for the slip days to be applied.

* **Grading**: The grading script will run one week after the project is
  released to provide test results on both released and hidden tests. The grader
  runs inside
  the [CS537-Docker container](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs537/useful-resources/cs537-docker).
  Grading results will be included in the `GRADING_SUMMARY.txt` file of the
  `grading` branch of your repository. On the due date, the grading script will
  run again, and will run once a day for the next three days. On the third day
  after the due date, the highest calculated grade will be transferred to
  Canvas. For example, if, when it runs on the due date you receive a score of
  70 / 100, and on the next day (1 day late) it runs and you also receive a
  score of 70 / 100 plus deducting 1 slip day, then it will transfer the 70 /
  100 with no slip day deduction. But if on the 1 day late run the grader
  calculates 71 / 100 plus deducting 1 slip day, then the 71 / 100 plus
  deducting 1 slip day will be transferred to Canvas.

* **Repository Structure**:  The solution folder of the `main` branch is what is
  pulled from your repository when running the grader.

* **LLM Usage**: For this course in particular we have seen these tools give
  close, but not quite right examples or explanations, that leave students more
  confused if they don't already know what the right answer is. Be aware that
  when you seek help from the instructional staff, we will not assist with
  working with these LLMs and we will expect you to be able to walk the
  instructional staff member through your code and logic.  **We do not recommend
  you use Large-Language Models such as ChatGPT**.

  - Online resources (e.g. stack overflow) and generative tools are transforming
    many industries including computer science and education. However, if you
    use online sources, you are required to turn in a document, `resources.txt`
    in the root of your project repository describing your uses of these
    sources.
  - Indicate in this document what percentage of your solution was done strictly
    by you and what was done utilizing these tools. Be specific, indicating
    sources used and how you interacted with those sources.
  - Not giving credit to outside sources is a form of plagiarism. It can be good
    practice to make comments of sources in your code where that source was
    used.
  - You will not be penalized for using LLMs or reading posts, but you should
    not create posts in online forums about the projects in the course. The
    majority of your code should also be written from your own efforts and you
    should be able to explain all the code you submit.

* **Exceptions**: Any exceptions to these project policies will need to be
  requested from the instructor.
